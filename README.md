## üìù Description 
<p align="justify"> During the pandemic, there was an exponential growth of food delivery apps in Brazil. Many of them brought up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe deliveryman being
his own manager, that this style of "employment" would be a "kick start" for his entrepreneurial career. This speech
enchanted many brazilians, but completely ignored the social reality of the country. Throughout this exponential growth, deliverymen began to protest
in Brazil against these apps, claiming that now their boss was the bills they needed to pay at home. Taking into account all the inconveniences
that are happening in this country, we saw the need to create an ecosystem in which the eyes are on the people that make the deliveries.
The idea of Snack Fair was born precisely to bring a new perspective to this market that has already proven itself to be consolidated. In this application, we need
conciliate the world of web2 (in which food apps are found today) with the transparency and accessibility that web3 brings to this job. Given this challenge, we found it very necessary to use the web3Auth tool and the polygon network, which facilitated the entry of new users
in this new experience that we are proposing. We also needed to illustrate and bring a UI to facilitate the navigation throughtout the website, so it was crucial
the use of IPFS to store images of establishments registered on the platform. This technology was also crucial for the creation
of the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 that carried everything in their metadata for their tracheability to be performed.
We want Snack Fair to be a great experience for all users, so we also propose a product tracheability system,
store inventory traceability, a stake system as a form of insurance for deliveries to happen correctly and a list of votes
for the homogeneous growth of the platform.
We understand that the food delivery market is consolidated in Brazil, so it is even more urgent to change the relationship with the
deliveryman. Therefore, we see Snack Fair as an excellent outlet bringing to the market a new way of ordering food.
The entire team was extremely happy with the final product. It was incredible the complexity of the project that we faced in 36 hours.
